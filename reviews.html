          Love these, for everyday wear. As a habitual hand washer I'm always looking for jewelry that doesn't tarnish and doesn't break the bank, and mine still look good as new.

          AMAZING!!!! This ring is so so cute! Make sure to take off rings before showering to keep in good condition.  I’m actually obsessed with all the rings I ordered and I will be ordering more!

          These are such cute rings but they break SO easily. I rate 3 stars because if you’re looking for cheap rings that can (mostly) adjust to your size then I’d recommend these. They all definitely have a limit of stretch. My largest ring size is 10 and most of them can stretch to fit but some will not budge (smiley face ones, frog, etc). Some others (“keep smiling” and the tentacle) broke before I even put them on. Oh and the ones with chains? Don’t even think about wearing those lol the chains fell off immediately.

          I think this ring is very beautiful, and love to wear it. However, I ordered one and it was actually just a ring pop. I returned it and was sent a new one. This new one just broke where the band is soldered to the back of the ring. It is too late to return it and I am highly disappointed.

          I ADORE this ring!!! It's gorgeous, seems well-made, and completely what I was hoping it would be. I only received it today, so I cannot speak to how it stands the test of time, but my first impression is "Wowzer!!!".
